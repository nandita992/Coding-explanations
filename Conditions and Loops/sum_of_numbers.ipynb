Then I increase my count and open the second finger and again mentally add 2 to my previous sums which was 1, which now becomes 3. Then i shout \"3\" and open my 3rd finger. I then add 3 to my sum mentally and now it's 6. As soon as i open my 4th finger, I would need to stop and exit the command and print the sums.
