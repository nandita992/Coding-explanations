Now our new number is 41. We again divide 41 by 10, and get 1 as our remainder. Now to add it to our string we do 5*10+1 and get 51. We divide 41//10 and receive our new number as 4. 4<0? True, we against performt the calculation. But when we do the floor division 4//10, we get 0.4. Now in int form 0.4<0? False. So we exit the loop and and print the reverse. \n",
